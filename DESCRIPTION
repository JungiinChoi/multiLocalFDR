Description: Software for computing a semiparametric mixture model to estimate the local false discovery rates from the p-values. The two pillars of the proposed approach are Efron's empirical null principle and log-concave density estimation for the alternative distribution. Our method outperforms other existing methods, in particular when the proportion of null is not that high. It is robust against the misspecification of alternative distribution. A unique feature of our method is that it can be extended to compute the local false discovery rates by combining multiple lists of p-values.
